# BookingRestaurantlySystem
The system allows customers to book a table on the restaurantâ€™s app or website. Customers select an available table, select a date and time, and enter a message if applicable. In addition to booking tables, the system also allows staff to manage and order food for each table during business hours. This makes it an easier management tool than traditional food record keeping.
