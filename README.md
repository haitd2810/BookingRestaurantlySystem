# BookingRestaurantlySystem
The system lets customers book a table on the restaurant's app or website. Customers choose an available table, pick a date and time, and select the number of people. They can also request outdoor seating or a private area. For the restaurant, the system makes booking easier and reduces staff phone bookings.
